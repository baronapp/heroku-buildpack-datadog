## Contributing

This project is open source (Apache 2 License), which means we're happy for you to fork it, but we'd be even more excited to have you contribute back to it.

### Submitting issues

* If you think you've found an issue, please search the [project issues](https://github.com/DataDog/heroku-buildpack-datadog/issues) first.
* If you can't find anything useful, please contact our [support team](http://docs.datadoghq.com/help/) and send a flare. To send a flare, you'll need get to your Dyno's command line:

  ```shell
  # From your project directory:
  heroku run bash

  # Once your Dyno has started and you are at the command line, send a flare:
  agent -c /app/.apt/etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml flare
  ```

  It can also be helpful to send logs from your running Dyno:
  ```shell
  # Download Datadog Agent logs
  heroku ps:copy /app/.apt/var/log/datadog/datadog.log --dyno=<YOUR DYNO NAME>

  # Download Datadog Trace Agent logs
  heroku ps:copy /app/.apt/var/log/datadog/datadog-apm.log --dyno=<YOUR DYNO NAME>
  ```

* Finally, you can open [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/DataDog/heroku-buildpack-datadog/issues).

### Pull requests

Have you fixed a bug or written a new check and want to share it? Many thanks!

Here are some tips to keep in mind when submitting a PR:

* Keep it small and focused. Avoid changing too many things at once.
* Summarize your PR with an explanatory title and a message describing your changes. Cross-reference any related bugs/PRs and provide steps for testing when appropriate.
* Write meaningful commit messages. The commit message should describe the reason for the change and give extra details that will allow someone later on to understand in 5 seconds the thing you've been working on for a day.
* Rebase your changes on `master` and **squash** your commits whenever possibleâ€”it keeps the history clean, and it's easier to revert later if necessary.

### Running the tests

This project comes with a set of tests to ensure that changes don't break the buildpack for current users. The tests are written using the [Heroku Buildpack Testrunner](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-testrunner).

To run the tests create a Heroku application that uses the [Heroku Buildpack Testrunner](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-testrunner) as Buildpack in the Datadog Heroku Buildpack Git repository folder:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/DataDog/heroku-buildpack-datadog.git
cd heroku-buildpack-datadog
heroku create --buildpack https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-testrunner
````

Once the testrunner is set as your buildpack's buildpack, push it to Heroku. This will automatically download and install shUnit2 and create a tests process for you:

```shell
git push heroku master
```

The tests execute the Datadog agent, so this new Heroku application will need to have your `DD_API_KEY` environment variable set for the tests to run correctly:

```shell
heroku config:set DD_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

Now, you can run your tests on Heroku:

```shell
heroku run tests
```
